COM_COMPONENTARCHITECT_XML_DESCRIPTION="<p>Component Architect is a Joomla! extension that allows for the automated code generation of other Joomla! extensions (components, modules and plugins).</p>
<p>Component Architect uses code templates which contain the basic files and code required for a component/extension, or a set of extensions, and this code is 'marked-up' using the Component Architect mark-up syntax. Each component/extension to be generated is defined in the definition tables of Component Architect together with the objects/tables, fieldsets, fields and field values required . The generation process applies a defined component/extension against a selected code template to produce a fully working Joomla! component/extension or set of extensions (e.g. a component with associated modules and plugins).</p>"

<p>So once installed this will be set to:<br /><code>help.componentarchitect.com/componentarchitect/v_1_1/{language}/j{major}x/{keyref}.html</code></p>
<p>To change this to use help files from your local system - which were installed with the Component Architect component - then just delete the value in this field.<br />
This will set the field to the local path for help files which is:<br /><code>components/com_modcreator/help/{language}/j{major}x/{keyref}.html</code> this is in the administrator section of the Joomla site but you most not include 'admnistrator' in the path.</p>
<p>You can switch back to the remote files by re-setting the help url to:<br /><code>help.componentarchitect.com/componentarchitect/v_1_1/{language}/j{major}x/{keyref}.html</code></p>
<p><strong>it is important to match the path's given above exactly including the automatic substitution values: {language}, {major} and {keyref}.</strong</p>"
